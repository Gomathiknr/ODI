# **Virat Kohli Career Dashboard (2008-2022)**

## **Project Overview**
This Power BI dashboard is designed to visualize the career statistics of Indian cricketer Virat Kohli from 2008 to 2022. The dashboard uses data sourced from his international matches in various formats (Test, ODI, T20) and provides insightful metrics on his batting performance, career milestones, and overall contribution to Indian cricket.

- **Form Analysis**: Analysis of Kohli's performance over time, including his batting average, consistency, and trends.
- **Milestones Tracker**: Tracking of significant milestones like centuries, half-centuries, and key match performances.
- **Comparison**: Compare Virat Kohli's performance against other cricketers or his own career progress over time.

## **Data Source**

## **Prerequisites**
Before you begin using the Power BI dashboard, ensure that you have the following:
- **Power BI Desktop** installed (version 2.8 or higher is recommended).
- The dataset file (CSV, Excel, or SQL database) containing Kohli’s career statistics from 2008-2022.

### **Recommended Power BI Version**
- Power BI Desktop (2008 version or higher)

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Load Data into Power BI**
   - Open Power BI Desktop.
   - Click on "Get Data" and choose the appropriate data source (CSV, Excel, or SQL Server).
   - Load the dataset file containing Virat Kohli's career statistics.

### 2. **Data Transformation**
   - In Power BI, go to the "Transform Data" option to open the Power Query editor.
   - Perform any necessary data cleaning and transformation tasks (e.g., handling missing data, converting date formats, etc.).
   - Ensure all columns are properly formatted for analysis (e.g., "Match Date" as Date type, "Runs Scored" as Integer, etc.).

### 3. **Building the Dashboard**
   - Create individual report pages for different aspects of Kohli’s career:
     - **Page 1**: Career Overview – Display key career statistics such as total runs, average, and centuries for each format.
     - **Page 2**: Match Performance – Use bar charts or line charts to show runs scored in each match over time.
     - **Page 3**: Form Analysis – Use trend lines or area charts to track his batting average and performance.
     - **Page 4**: Milestones Tracker – Create milestone markers (like 100th century or 50th half-century) on a timeline.

### 4. **Visualization Tips**
   - **Bar Charts** for comparisons (e.g., runs scored in each format or against each opposition).
   - **Line Charts** for trends over time (e.g., career average or strike rate).
   - **Pie Charts** to represent percentage distribution of Kohli's performance in Tests, ODIs, and T20Is.
   - **Tables** for detailed match-wise statistics (including runs, balls faced, opposition, etc.).
   - **Slicers** to filter data by year, format, or opposition.

### 5. **Add Key Insights**
   - **Kohli’s Average by Format**: Show the batting average across different formats.
   - **Run Scoring Patterns**: Display how his strike rate and average have evolved over the years.
   - **Century Milestones**: Highlight the years where Kohli scored his most centuries and half-centuries.
   - **Player Comparison**: If applicable, compare Kohli’s stats against other famous players (e.g., Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting) using bar charts or line charts.

## **Usage Instructions**

### **Interacting with the Dashboard**
- Use the **slicers** (on the right side or top of the dashboard) to filter the data by:
  - Year (2008-2022)
  - Match Format (Test, ODI, T20)
  - Opposition
- Hover over data points in the charts for detailed statistics (such as runs scored in a particular match).
- Use the **Milestones Tracker** to quickly identify Kohli's key career moments.
  
### **Key Metrics to Watch**
- **Total Runs by Year**: A breakdown of how Kohli has contributed to India’s total runs each year.
- **Batting Average**: The average runs per match in each format.
- **Centuries and Half-Centuries**: Count and trends of Kohli’s centuries and half-centuries.
- **Strike Rate**: Analyze how his strike rate has varied across different formats and over time.

## **Customization**
You can customize this dashboard by:
- Adding more statistics or visualizations (e.g., partnerships, player performance vs specific bowlers).
- Changing color schemes and visual elements to match your preferred style or brand.
- Adding more filters for deeper analysis (e.g., home vs away matches).

## **Troubleshooting**
- **Data Not Loading**: Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and there are no corrupt files.
- **Visuals Not Displaying Correctly**: Check that the fields are correctly mapped to the axes of your charts.
- **Slow Performance**: If your data size is large, try reducing the dataset or optimizing the Power Query steps.

## **License & Credits**
- Data sourced from publicly available cricket databases (e.g., ESPNcricinfo, CricketStats).
- This dashboard is for personal use and educational purposes only.

### Example of how this would look in Power BI:
